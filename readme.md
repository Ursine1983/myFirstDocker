**Project Overview**

The goal is to create a tool similar to XAMPP but to allow the user to create an identical server environment to the production system localy.



**Project Phases**

1. Prof of concept / learning
In this phase I want to make sure my idea is viable and also learn to work with docker and powershell in the process. At the end of this phase I should have a specific webserver setup that I can launch via a shell script.

*Status: Done*

2. Parameters and Configuration
In this phase I want to refactor the code so that I can easily configure the environment I want to set up by using parameters and configuration files. The dockerfile itself should be able to be generated dynamically depending on the parameters and configurations.

*Status: Pending*

3. Client UI
In this phase I want to encapsulate the scripts into a Java application with a UI to allow users to configure, start/stop and manage thier environments. It would be great if I can let the user run serveral setups at the same time but I will have to evaluate if that is possible/desierable

*Status: Pending*


**Project Timeline**

As I do not have any deadlines to meet with this project and the primary goal for me personally is learning the timeline is not as strict as it would have to be for productive projects. As such I plan to finish phase 2 by the end of July and phase 3 by the end of october. Changes in my work situation may effect these estimates.
